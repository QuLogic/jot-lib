 * TITLE   :    Data Stream Class
 * DESCR   :	This class provides safe data transfer for objects and
 * 		non-object data with a syntax similar to that of the
 * 		standard C++ iostreams.  The simple non-object data types
 * 		have pack and unpack methods defined for them with the
 * 		appropriate conversions built in to avoid byte-order
 * 		problems and ensure architecture independence.  Objects
 * 		that define their own pack and unpack methods should use
 * 		these primitive routines.
