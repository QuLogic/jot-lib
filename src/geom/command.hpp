/*!
 *  \brief Base class for "commands" that can be executed 
 *  (COMMAND::doit()) and undone (COMMAND::undoit()).
 *
 *  A COMMAND can be in one of 3 possible states:
 *  
 *  - done:   doit() was executed.
 *  - undone: undoit() was executed after doit().
 *  - clear:  neither doit() nor undoit() have been called.
 *  
 *  For many types of commands, there is no difference
 *  between 'undone' and 'clear'. An example of where the two
 *  WOULD be different is a command that generates a portion
 *  of mesh in doit(), but in undoit() simply hides the
 *  portion of mesh instead of destroying it. That way,
 *  redoing the command by calling doit() after undoit()
 *  would be relatively lightweight: the portion of mesh
 *  would be unhidden rather than regenerated.
 *  
 *  The virtual method COMMAND::clear() is used to transition
 *  from state 'undone' to state 'clear'; e.g. the mesh
 *  generation command in the example above would delete the
 *  region of mesh in clear(), returning the command (and the
 *  mesh) to its initial state before the first doit() was
 *  executed. Most derived classes will not need to override
 *  COMMAND::clear().
 *  
 *  The following are the actions that can be taken from
 *  each state:
 *  
 *    state: 'clear'
 *      doit()   changes state to 'done'
 *      undoit() is a no-op
 *      clear()  is a no-op
 *  
 *    state: 'done'
 *      doit()   is a no-op
 *      undoit() changes state to 'undone'
 *      clear()  is an invalid action
 *  
 *    state: 'undone'
 *      doit()   changes state to 'done'
 *      undoit() is a no-op
 *      clear()  changes state to 'clear'
