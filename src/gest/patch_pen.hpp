 *
 * User manual:
 *
 *      Tap on a triangle to start a new patch.
 *
 *      Draw a stroke starting on a triangle T to move all faces
 *      under the stroke to T's patch.
 *
 *      If the stroke is closed (ends near its beginning), all
 *      triangles that lie partially or fully inside the stroke
 *      (in screen space) are moved to T's patch.
 *
 *      Undo/redo are supported.
