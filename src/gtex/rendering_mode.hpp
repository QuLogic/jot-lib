 *  \brief Contains the definitions of classes that make it easier to create
 *  gTextures that have multiple rendering modes.  That is, they have multiple
 *  ways to achieve the same effect.  The mode that is used usually depends on
 *  the capabilities of the graphics card that is available.

/*!
 *  \brief The abstract interface for a rendering mode.
 *
 *  Rendering modes determine how a gTexture is rendered (for example, using
 *  just shaders, using shaders and textures, or using no shaders).
 *
 *  Concrete rendering modes should subclass this class and override one or more
 *  of the setup_for_drawing or after_drawing methods.  Subclasses should also
 *  create their own subclass of RenderingModeStripCB to act as the GLStripCB for
 *  their gTexture.  The get_new_strip_cb() method should be overriden to return
 *  a newly allocated one of these RenderingModeStripCB subclasses.
 *
 *  \note Each concrete rendering mode is responsible for managing all the OpenGL
 *  resources it needs for rendering.  These resources will most likely be
 *  allocated in the rendering mode's constructor and deallocated in the
 *  destructor.
