JOT Project Coding and Style Conventions

Introduction:

This document contains coding and style conventions to be used when writing
code for the JOT project.  Note that currently, much of the JOT code does
not necessarily use these conventions (or at least, all of these conventions).
However, new code being added to JOT should follow these conventions and any
old code that is being revised or rewritten should be modified to follow these
conventions.

Change Log:

08-Mar-2005
Added section on line length.

21-Feb-2005
Initial draft.  Not all conventions have been thought of or handled at this
point.  Numerous additions (and probably changes as well) are likely to come
in the (hopefully near) future.  As a result, try to follow the conventions
that are here.  For anything that isn't here, either ask about it or code as
you like (but try to be consistent).

1.  General Conventions

1a. Indentation

When indenting, the indent size should be 3 spaces.  Space (' ') characters
should be used instead of the tab characters (in most editors you should be
able to enable an option similar to 'use spaces instead of tabs').

1b. Variables Naming

All variable names should be in lowercase with underscores ('_')
between words.

Example:

   bool is_rigid_motion;

1c. Code Blocks

Unless otherwise stated, general code blocks should be laid out in so-called
"Linux style".  That is, opening curly-braces ('{') should be at the end of the
statement begining the block and closing curly-braces ('}') should be on a
line by themselves on the same indentation level as the statement begining the
block.  The contents of the block should be indented.

Example:

   if (is_rigid_motion) {
      rigid_motion_func();
   } else {
      non_rigid_motion_func()
   }

1d. Include Guards

To prevent multiple declaration of code in header files, all header files should
have include guards.  At the begining of every header file (that is, before any
other code), there should be two preprocessor statements.  The first checks to
see if a unique preprocessor symbol has not yet been defined (this is #ifndef).
The second defines that unique symbol (this is #define).  The unique symbol
should be in all uppercase and use the following pattern:

<header file name>_IS_INCLUDED

Periods in the header file name should be repaces with underscores ('_').
There should also be one preprocessor statement at the end of each header file
(that is, after all code in the file).  This should be a #endif statement
followed on the same line by a comment containing the unique preprocessor symbol
for the header file.

Example:

#ifndef MLIB_H_IS_INCLUDED
#define MLIB_H_IS_INCLUDED

// ... Code for the header file ...

#endif // MLIB_H_IS_INCLUDED

// end of file mlib.H

(A comment should indicate the end of the file, as above).

1e. File Names

File names should end in '.C' for C++ source files and '.H' for C++ header files.

1f. Line Length

Lines in source code should be approximately 80 characters long.  That is, try
to keep all lines to less than or equal to 80 character in length, but if you
need to go a few characters over to squeeze something in, that's ok.

2.  Documentation and Commenting

2a. Doxygen

The JOT project is using Doxygen to autmatically generate documentation for its
code.  It is recommended that everyone working on JOT read through the first
few sections of the Doxygen manual to learn how it works.

A short tutorial on Doxygen will probably be written here at some point in
addition to some conventions on the particular Doxygen commenting style to use.
For now, we recommend QT style (using '!').

Example:

/*!
 *  \file points.H
 *  \brief Definitions of geometry classes for various coordinate systems.
 *  \ingroup group_MLIB
 *
 *  \remark This file should probably be renamed to something like
 *  coordinate_systems.H.
 *
 */

3.  Function Conventions

3a. Naming

Function names will be all lowercase with underscores ('_') between words.
Function parameters will use the same conventions.

3b. Layout

As with regular code blocks, functions will be laid out "Linux style".  That is,
the return value of a function will be on a line by itself immediately
preceeding the function name and parameter list.  The opening curly-brace ('{')
of the function will also be on a line by itself, immediately after the function
name and parameter list.  Thus function code will be indented after the opening
curly-brace and will have the closing curly-brace ('}') after it, on a line by
itself at the same indent level as the opening curly-brace.

Examples:

Mat4
Mat4::Inverse()
{

   // ... Function code here ...
   
}

4.  Class Conventions

4a. Naming

Class names should start with an uppercase letter (or, occasionally, with a few
uppercase letters) and then use lowercase characters thereafter.  Underscores
should be used to seperate words (except between the uppercase and lowercase
part of the name).

Examples:

class Wpoint;
class XYpoint;
class XYpoint_list;

It is common practive in the JOT source code to typedef const versions of a
class as the name of the class prepended with an uppercase 'C'.

Examples:

typedef const Wpoint CWpoint;

If a class is reference counted (using the JOT reference counting code), its
name should be in all uppercase characters.

Examples:

   GELptr gel = new GEL();
